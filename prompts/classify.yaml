    # Your Task
    
    Analyze this content and provide complete classification metadata following these steps:
    
    1. **Understand the content**: What is this work actually doing? What are its main contributions?
    2. **Assess technical depth**: Does this present original technical research, technical agendas, or is it commentary/news about research?
    3. **Evaluate safety relevance**: How directly does this relate to preventing unintended effects from advanced AI systems?
    4. **Match to taxonomy**: Which leaf categories best fit the actual technical work being done?
    5. **Apply Shallow Review standards**: Would this belong in a premier technical review of AI safety research?
    
    # AI Safety and Alignment Scope
    
    **Relevant work includes:**
    - Technical AI alignment and safety research
    - Interpretability and understanding of AI systems
    - AI control, monitoring, and evaluation methods
    - Multi-agent AI safety and coordination
    - Formal methods, verification, and provable safety
    - Agent foundations and theoretical alignment work
    - Governance-adjacent technical work (evals, standards, safety cases)
    - Borderline technical topics offering novel causal perspectives on AI X-risk
    
    **Intent over method:** If work aims to understand or prevent unintended effects from advanced AI systems, it's relevant, regardless of specific technical approach or framing.
    
    # Common Classification Pitfalls
    
    **Forecasting vs evals:** Forecasting is NOT evaluation (evals test current models), BUT technical capability forecasting that develops statistical models, analyzes eval/benchmark trends, or otherwise contributes technical methodology gets MODERATE-HIGH inclusion (0.50-0.75) as it significantly informs technical research. Pure timelines speculation gets low inclusion.
    
    **System cards vs research:** System cards document evaluations but aren't the research itself. Score as news/documentation (SR <0.4) unless exceptionally detailed with novel methodology.
    
    **Authoritative frameworks:** Preparedness frameworks, RSPs, and technical agendas from major labs/orgs (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenPhil, Redwood, MIRI, etc.) get high inclusion (0.70-0.85) as they authoritatively inform research direction, even if not presenting original research.
    
    **Commentary vs research:** Overview posts and news summaries get low inclusion (<0.4). Technical critiques from a technical standpoint (feasibility, promise) get HIGH inclusion (>0.7). Position papers proposing new agendas fulfill this criteria.
    
    **Access errors:** If content unavailable (errors, paywalls, format issues), set `kind="error_detected"` and `confidence=0.0`.
    
    # Key Scoring Guidelines
    
    ## AI Safety Relevance (0.0-1.0)
    
    How relevant is this content to AI safety/alignment as a topic area?
    
    - **0.9-1.0**: Core safety work directly addressing alignment challenges, X-risk, or control problems
    - **0.7-0.9**: Clearly safety-focused work with direct implications for AI safety
    - **0.5-0.7**: Work with safety connections or implications for understanding AI behavior
    - **0.3-0.5**: General AI research with some safety relevance
    - **0.1-0.3**: Mainstream AI/ML with minimal safety connection
    - **0.0-0.1**: No connection to AI safety/alignment
    
    ## Shallow Review Inclusion Suitability (0.0-1.0)
    
    How suitable is this for inclusion in Shallow Review 2025? Focus on technical depth and original contribution - the "Shallow Review spirit":
    
    **Core inclusion criteria:**
    - ✅ Original technical research (empirical or theoretical)
    - ✅ Technical research agendas, roadmaps, or frameworks
    - ✅ Novel technical tools, benchmarks, or datasets for safety research
    - ✅ Technical critiques with substantive analysis
    - ❌ News/commentary about research (unless unclear if we have the original)
    - ❌ Opinion pieces or think pieces without technical contribution
    - ❌ Summaries or reviews without novel insights
    - ❌ Mainstream AI work tangentially mentioning safety
    
    **Scale:**
    - **0.9-1.0**: Major original technical safety research or comprehensive technical agendas (must include)
    - **0.7-0.9**: Significant technical contributions with solid empirical or theoretical work
    - **0.5-0.7**: Decent technical work, tool releases, or position papers with technical substance
    - **0.3-0.5**: Marginal technical contribution or preliminary results
    - **0.1-0.3**: Commentary, news, or summaries about research (not the research itself)
    - **0.0-0.1**: No technical contribution (pure journalism, opinion pieces)
    
    **Critical distinction**: Content can be highly relevant to AI safety but unsuitable for Shallow Review if it lacks original technical contribution. Pieces *about* research (not the research itself) typically score <0.4 on inclusion.
    
    # Required Output Fields

      - 1 sentence: Why this inclusion suitability score?
    - **confidence**: Your confidence in this classification 0.0-1.0 (NOT about work quality - about YOUR certainty)
    
    # Analysis Instructions
    
    Before providing your final JSON output, work through your analysis step by step in your thinking. Include:
    
    1. **Content Analysis**: What is this work actually doing? Quote key passages that indicate the main claims, methods, and contributions.
    
    2. **Technical Depth Assessment**: Quote specific passages that show whether this presents original research, extends existing methods, provides new tools/frameworks, or is commentary about others' work. What makes it technically valuable or not?
    
    3. **Safety Relevance Evaluation**: Quote passages that show connections to preventing unintended effects from advanced AI systems. Is it core safety work, safety-adjacent, or tangentially related?
    
    4. **Metadata Extraction**: Systematically go through each required field and extract the information from the content, noting if any information is missing or unclear.
    
    5. **Taxonomy Matching**: List out 3-4 potential leaf categories from the taxonomy and consider arguments for why each might or might not fit. Which specific categories best match the actual technical work being done?
    
    6. **Scoring Justification**: For both ai_safety_relevance and shallow_review_inclusion, consider arguments for higher and lower scores based on the rubrics, then justify your final scores.

    **Remember:**
    - Use only leaf category IDs from the provided taxonomy
    - Technical critiques from a technical standpoint get HIGH inclusion (>0.7) if substantive
    - Authoritative frameworks from major orgs get HIGH inclusion (0.70-0.85) even if not original research
    - System cards are documentation (SR <0.4), NOT the evaluation research itself
    - Technical capability forecasting with statistical models/methodology gets MODERATE-HIGH inclusion (0.50-0.75)
    - Be conservative with inclusion scores - original technical research should score higher than commentary
    - High safety relevance + low technical contribution = low inclusion score
    - Quote key passages in your thinking to ground your analysis
    - For access errors: use `kind="error_detected"` and `confidence=0.0`
    - Your final output should consist only of the JSON classification
