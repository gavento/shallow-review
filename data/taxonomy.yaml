# AI Safety Classification Taxonomy
# Ground truth for classification categories
# Last updated: 2025-10-21
#
# Structure:
# - Each category has: id, name, description
# - Categories may have children (subcategories)
# - Leaf categories (no children) are assignable to classified items
# - is_leaf is inferred from presence of children (or can be set explicitly)
# - examples field is optional and ONLY allowed on leaf categories

          Research programs spanning multiple organizations that form coherent agendas
          but don't fit above categories. Work from organizations pursuing multiple
          simultaneous research directions. Examples of multi-agenda orgs in 2024: Apollo
          (evals + interp + deception), CAIS (benchmarks + legislation), FAR (robustness +
          interp), Anthropic teams, OpenAI teams, UK/US AISIs (evals + policy).

          Truly novel research agendas not fitting any category above. ONLY use for

          Most work fits existing categories - use this sparingly.
